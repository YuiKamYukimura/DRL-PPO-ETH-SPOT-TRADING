# DRL-PPO-ETH-SPOT-TRADING

A cryptocurrency spot trading bot using PPO deep reinforcement learning algorithm on ETH spot market.

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a cryptocurrency spot trading bot using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) deep reinforcement learning algorithm on the ETH spot market. The bot will be capable of making trading decisions in real-time based on historical data and learned strategies.

## Features
- **Deep Reinforcement Learning**: Utilizing PPO algorithm.
- **Real-time Trading**: Making decisions based on live data.
- **Backtesting**: Test strategies on historical data.

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter notebook `PPO_DRL_ETH_SPOT.ipynb`.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess data, construct the environment, train the model, and run the trading bot.

## Requirements
To install the necessary dependencies, run:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
